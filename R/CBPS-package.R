#' @source Data from the National Supported Work Study.  A benchmark matching
#' dataset.  Columns consist of an indicator for whether the observed unit was
#' in the experimental subset; an indicator for whether the individual received
#' the treatment; age in years; schooling in years; indicators for black and
#' Hispanic; an indicator for marriage status, one of married; an indicator for
#' no high school degree; reported earnings in 1974, 1975, and 1978; and
#' whether the 1974 earnings variable is missing.  Data not missing 1974
#' earnings are the Dehejia-Wahba subsample of the LaLonde data.  Missing
#' values for 1974 earnings set to zero. 1974 and 1975 earnings are
#' pre-treatment.  1978 earnings is taken as the outcome variable.
