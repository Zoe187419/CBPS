\title{Covariate Balancing Propensity Score (CBPS) for Marginal Structural Models}
\description{
  \code{CBMSM} estimates propensity scores such that both covariate balance and prediction of treatment assignment are maximized.  With longitudinal data, the method returns marginal structural model weights that can be entered directly into a linear model.  The method also handles multiple binary treatments administered concurrently.}
\usage{
	  CBMSM(formula, id, time, data, type="MSM", twostep = TRUE, 
			msm.variance = "approx", time.vary = FALSE, ...)
	  CBMSM.fit(treat, X, id, time, MultiBin.fit, twostep,
				msm.variance, time.vary, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{formula}{A list of formulas of the form treat ~ X.  The function assumes that there is one formula for each time, and they are ordered from the first time to the last time.}
  \item{id}{A vector which identifies the unit associated with each row of treat and X.}
  \item{time}{A vector which identifies the time period associated with each row of treat and X.}
  \item{data}{An optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables in the model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from \code{environment(formula)}, typically the environment from which \code{CBMSM} is called.}
  \item{twostep}{Set to \code{TRUE} to use a two-step estimator, which will run substantially faster than continuous-updating.  Default is \code{FALSE}, which uses the continuous-updating estimator described by Imai and Ratkovic (2014).}
  \item{msm.variance}{Default is \code{FALSE}, which uses the low-rank approximation of the variance described in Imai and Ratkovic (2014).  Set to \code{TRUE} to use the full variance matrix.}
  \item{time.vary}{Default is \code{FALSE}, which uses the same coefficients across time period.  Set to \code{TRUE} to fit one set per time period.}
  \item{treat}{A vector of treatment assignments.  For N observations over T time periods, the length of treat should be N*T.}
  \item{X}{A covariate matrix.  For N observations over T time periods, X should have N*T rows.}
  \item{type}{"MSM" for a marginal structural model, with multiple time periods or "MultiBin" for multiple binary treatments at the same time period.}
  \item{MultiBin.fit}{A parameter for whether the multiple binary treatments occur concurrently (\code{FALSE}) or over consecutive time periods (\code{TRUE}) as in a marginal structural model.  Setting type = "MultiBin" when calling \code{CBMSM} will set MultiBin.fit to \code{TRUE} when CBMSM.fit is called.}
  \item{...}{Other parameters to be passed through to \code{optim()}}
}
\details{Fits covariate balancing propensity scores for marginal structural models.}
\value{
  \item{weights}{The optimal weights.}
  \item{fitted.values}{The fitted propensity score for each observation.}
  \item{y}{The treatment vector used.}
  \item{x}{The covariate matrix.}
  \item{id}{The vector id used in CBMSM.fit.}
  \item{time}{The vector time used in CBMSM.fit.}
  \item{model}{The model frame.}
  \item{call}{The matched call.}
  \item{formula}{The formula supplied.}
  \item{data}{The data argument.}
  \item{treat.hist}{A matrix of the treatment history, with each observation in rows and time in columns.}
  \item{treat.cum}{A vector of the cumulative treatment history, by individual.}

##Results in a quicker fit but with poorer balance
